            honestly, world generation ain't all that. but it is REALLY neat!
        </p>
        <p>
            let me break it down!

            first, i start by generating a cellular noise map, similarly to a voronoi diagram
        </p>

        <p>
            then, depending on the number of biomes that are available, i split it (you can add weights here so certain biomes show more or less)
            additionally, you can add a moisture map or a heap map, to generate certain biomes in certain places. but it wasnt necessary for my game.
        </p>
        <p>
            the issue is that hard edges between biomes looks like shit, so i apply a gaussian blur to it, so now the biome transition is smooth(er).
            then, i go through the image and check each pixel's value, so i can tell which biomes it should belong to (30% plains, 70% mountains, perhaps?)
        </p>

        <p>
            each biome i have has its own custom noise map. a desert has a cellular noise map with a euclidian distance function. this gives the appearance of dunes.
            something like the plains biome might just have a basic perlin noise function with two octaves.
        </p>

        <p>
            based on the weight of the pixel, i weight each noise map differently.
            the benefit of doing this, is that each noise map blends peoperly, so there aren't any terrible jumps in biomes/terrain.
        </p>
        <p>
            we now have a heightmap, which we can just apply to a mesh and a collision shape.

            obviously there is so much more i can do with this, such as hydraulic erosion, which i intend to implement soon.
