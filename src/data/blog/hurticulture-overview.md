description: A case study about horror PEPER games, such as Lethal Company, Content Warning & KLETKA.

## Overview

My favorite genre of g

ame are extraction games, but not traditional extraction games like Escape from Tarkov. I particularly enjoy coop horror extraction games like _Lethal Company_, _KLETKA_, _Content Warning_, _Pilgrim_, _Phasmophobia_ and _Murky Divers_ fall under this umbrella. While not limited to horror, these games thrive in that genre because tension enhances each stage in the loop.

There are adjacent genres, such as extraction shooters, like 

Jesse Schell defines a game as, "a problem-solving activity, approached with a playful attitude," and constantly games will give you problems and choices to pick from. "Should I purchase ammunition or a medkit?", "Should I go into the forest, or go into the city?"

PEPER games provide you with a unique choice that many other games won't.


## "How much do you value your friend?"
I'm a very social person, and I've always played multiplayer games. I honestly don't play many games that aren't multiplayer, and if I am playing a singleplayer game, its frequently while I'm streaming for a friend in Discord.

The thing that primarily draws me towards PEPER games is that they're intimately multiplayer. It's not like a game of Counterstrike where you can play the game without any microphone or global chat. PEPER games thrive off of your relationships with your friends.

Every single time you play, you'll be tempted to sacrifice your friend's life for an alarm clock.

This is because PEPER games have a "for the good of the team" mentality. In a traditional extraction game like Escape from Tarkov, players are playing for themselves. "_I_ want that GPU.", "_I_ want that MCX SPEAR.". Of course, you want to help your friends, but in the end, you're playing for yourself. In a game like KLETKA, you're well aware that your greed will lead to your demise.

You could argue that a game like Counterstrike has the same sort of design philosophy, where you want your team to win. You'd be partially correct, but the main distinction between these styles of games is that Counterstrike isn't a coop game. In Counterstrike, I don't really care if my team wins or not as long as I win the game. This is because I don't have any personal connection with my teammates, and the game itself is very competitive. Even if you're playing in a five-stack, the game is still competitive. Someone is the top frag and someone is the bottom frag, one team wins and one team loses.

Going back to KLETKA,
